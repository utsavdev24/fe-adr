# 7. Use of absolute imports

Date: 2024-01-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The codebase relies on relative imports for module dependencies, causing potential challenges as the project grows.

## Decision

Transition to using absolute imports in the codebase, specifying the complete path from the project's root directory when importing modules or components.

## Consequences

- Enhanced Codebase Clarity: Absolute imports contribute to better clarity regarding the locations of imported components and modules.
- Improved Scalability: The use of absolute imports is expected to scale more effectively as the codebase expands.

## Code Example

Before (Relative Import):

```javascript
import SomeComponent from '../../components/SomeComponent';
```

After (Absolute Import):
```javascript
import SomeComponent from '@/components/SomeComponent';
```
