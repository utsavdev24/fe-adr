# 9. Don't keep unreachable Code without clear explanation

Date: 2024-01-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The codebase contains sections of unused or obsolete code, leading to increased maintenance overhead and potential confusion for developers. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving code quality, maintainability, and development efficiency.

## Decision

Unused or unreachable code should be removed from the codebase, including but not limited to:

1. Deprecated functions, classes, or modules.
2. Unused variables, constants, or imports.
3. Orphaned comments or documentation.

For an exception to happen, there needs to be a clear explanation for it, either as a big comment, or as a clear TODO.

## Consequences

- **Codebase Streamlining:** The removal of unused code contributes to a cleaner and more focused codebase.
- **Reduced Maintenance Overhead:** Eliminating unnecessary code reduces the cognitive load on developers and minimizes the risk of introducing bugs or issues during future development.
- **Potential Temporary Disruption:** Depending on the scope of removal, there may be a short-term impact on ongoing development as team members adjust to the changes.
