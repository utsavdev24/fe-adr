# 11. Naming Conventions for Git Branches, PRs, and Commits

Date: 2024-01-11

## Status

Proposed

## Context

In our software development process, there is an inconsistency in the naming of branches, pull requests (PRs), and commits. This lack of standardized naming conventions leads to confusion, makes navigating the codebase challenging, and hampers understanding the project's history and the purpose of changes. The need for a clear, organized, and consistent approach is evident to enhance clarity, traceability, and readability of our codebase.

## Decision

1. **Branch Naming:**

   - Format: `{type}/{short-description}`
   - Example: `feat/add-user-authentication`

2. **Pull Request (PR) Titles:**

   - Format: `[{Type}] {JIRA-ticket}: {Brief Description}`
   - Types include `Feature`, `Bugfix`, `Hotfix`, `Release`, `Docs`, etc.
   - Example: `AL-2222: Add User Authentication`

3. **Commit Messages:**
   - Format: `{type}({scope}): {Short, Imperative Summary of Changes}`
   - Types include `feat`, `fix`, `refac`, `docs`, `test`, etc.
   - Scope is the component being edited by the commit (ProfileComponent, SignUpStepper, Auth, etc.). Can be `*` if the commit touches the full project.
   - Example: `feat: Add user authentication module`

The adoption of these conventions is aimed at facilitating easier navigation of the project history, enhancing traceability between tasks and code changes, and improving readability for code reviews.

## Consequences

This decision will have multiple benefits:

- Improved organization and clarity in the codebase.
- Enhanced traceability between project management tasks and code changes.
- Better readability and understanding of the project's history and ongoing changes.
