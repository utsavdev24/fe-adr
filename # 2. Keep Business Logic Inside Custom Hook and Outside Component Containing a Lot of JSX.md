# 2. Keep Business Logic Inside Custom Hook and Outside Component Containing a Lot of JSX

Date: 2024-01-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our React application's components have grown in size and complexity, mixing business logic with JSX, which makes them difficult to understand, maintain, and test. Observing practices in the community and other projects, abstracting business logic into custom hooks significantly simplifies components, making them more readable and maintainable.

## Decision

Our components have their business logic seperate into custom hooks. Each component has a corresponding custom hook that contains its business logic. The component itself is then responsible only for rendering and handling UI-related logic, using the custom hook for all business logic. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, enhancing the maintainability, readability, and testability of the code.

## Code Examples

### Example Custom Hook - useUserProfile

*useUserProfile.js*:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useUserProfile(userId) {
    const [userDetails, setUserDetails] = useState(null);
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

    useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchUserDetails() {
            try {
                const data = await getUserDetails(userId);
                setUserDetails(data);
            } catch (err) {
                setErrors(prevErrors => ({ ...prevErrors, fetch: 'Unable to fetch user details' }));
            }
        }
        fetchUserDetails();
    }, [userId]);

    // Other business logic

    return { userDetails, errors };
}

export default useUserProfile;
```

**UserProfileComponent Using useUserProfile**

*UserProfileComponent.js:*

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useUserProfile from './useUserProfile';

function UserProfileComponent({ userId }) {
    const { userDetails, errors } = useUserProfile(userId);

    return (
        <div>
            {errors.fetch && <p>{errors.fetch}</p>}
            {userDetails ? (
                <div>
                    <h1>{userDetails.name}</h1>
                    {/* More user details here */}
                </div>
            ) : (
                <p>Loading user details...</p>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}
```

By applying this architecture decision, components in the React application become more focused on rendering and less burdened with business logic. This leads to an overall improvement in the codebase's maintainability, readability, and scalability.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
    - **Improved Readability and Maintenance:** Components become cleaner and focus solely on rendering logic. This separation makes both parts easier to understand and maintain.
    - **Reusability:** Business logic in hooks can be more easily shared between components, promoting DRY principles.
    - **Testability:** Isolating business logic makes it easier to write unit tests for the logic and the UI components separately.
- **Cons:**
    - **Learning Curve:** Team members need to familiarize themselves with this pattern, which may initially slow development.
    - **Potential for Over-Abstraction:** If not implemented carefully, there might be an excessive number of hooks leading to confusion or "prop drilling" issues.
